How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The way that I do this is by running tests multiple times and compiling to make sure that I have no errors in my code. I always make sure to write down the requirements and look for the part of my code that solves those requirements, then I comment them so I make sure I have them all.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The way that I do this is by learning the requirements and figuring out what each user will be using the program for. I try to put myself in the eyes of a user and see what they would need to have easily available and make sure that the application is neat.

How do I approach designing software?
The way that I approach designing software is by learning the requirements and writing them down. Once I have them written down and memorized, I begin to write my pseudocode to see how I will approach solving the problems. Then I comment out portions of the code labeling where each requirement is fulfilled. Then I like to test multiple times trying to break my program until I am sure that I have caught all of the errors.
